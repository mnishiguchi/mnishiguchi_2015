# Styling header

```css
    header {
      text-align: center;
    }

    /* By default our browser gives the list some padding on the left
    to make room for the bullet points, which causes the links to be off-center. */
    ul {
      padding: 10px;
    }

    /* Make the links all line up next to each other in a row */
    li {
      display: inline;
      padding: 0 10px;
    }
```
